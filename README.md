# Battleship
Battleship game I made in php/SQL.

This game can be started with index.hmtl. As it is currently there are only 2 players allowed and when a user logs in they must enter
a '1' or a '2' in order for the game to properly function. The SQL server is run off local host with the $username being the username
to the SQL database, $password being the password to the database, $dbServer being the server of the SQL database, and $dbName being
the schema to use.
